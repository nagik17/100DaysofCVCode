# 100 Days of CV Code

An initiative taken by me ([Prajit Mukherjee](https://github.com/thegeekbong)) to be able to create and apply the concepts of the vast field of Computer Vision. 

### Telegram Group
During this course of learning and application, a Telegram [group](https://t.me/joinchat/J2McLRmDbMj3Kr56fVXRDw) will be maintained. 

### Motivation of the Initiative
From  warning  sleep  deprived  drivers  to  helping  in  early  prognosis  of  life-threatening ailments like Cancer, computer vision is quite prominent in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
With applications in field of education, transportation, military  and  many  more,  computer  vision  is  set  to  be  the  moving  power  of changing the machines as we know it. As a community person, it is important for us to give back something worthwhile to the community and what’s better than applying the most lucrative field of AI.
100 Days of CV code is a commitment to ourselves of getting to know about this field a bit more and work on this field in the near future.

### Goal of this  Initiative

**By the end of this 100 Days of CV code journey, I would like to be able to show rich code containing my applications of the concepts of Computer Vision.**
I’d also like to document my journey and explain the  mathematics  concepts under Computer Vision, though to the bare minimum.
***The most important of all*** – I want to provide a free coursework and add to all the resources of Computer Vision already present over the internet. This would help anyone wanting to work in this amazing field, a dedicated curriculum and help them achieve their own goals from this.


### Prerequisites of joining this initiative

People with some knowledge of Machine Learning and Python programming will be able to do this coursework easily.
Mathematics concepts of:
- Linear Algebra
- Probability  Theory and Statistics
- Multivariate Calculus

will help you grasp the concepts better.
The initiative is for people looking for specialising in one field of Deep Learning and has worked in the field of Machine Learning or AI.

### Pledge to  join the group

1. I pledge to dedicateat a minimum of one hour of everyday towards coding and/or learning the concepts of Computer Vision and move a step closer to the goal of this coursework.
2. I pledge to write about my progress in any social media of my choice with the hashtag #100DaysofCV.
3. If  and  when  applicable,  I  will  post  all  relevant  codes  to  the  public repository on Github and also the notes that I maintain while working in the coursework, for helping others in their journey.
